# Object(s)
1. X-Example is a placeholder object designed to help newly recruited agents understand how to write a proper entity classification document.

## Hazard 01: "Hazard Explanation"
Each Hazard header contains information about one effect of the object(s).

Hazard: This section contains keywords describing the harmful effects of the Hazard. For instance, an object that inflicts headaches upon people near it might have the Mind keyword here. Any Hazard capable of independent movement is assumed to be dangerous in melee combat, in addition to any other keywords it has.

Mechanism: This section contains keywords describing the 'trigger mechanism' of the Hazard. For instance, a wand that has to be waved over an object to have an effect might have the Hands-On keyword here.

Time: This section contains keywords describing the length of time over which the effect applies. For instance, if it takes around a month of exposure to the object to notice problems, the keyword Month goes here. Of special note is the "Lightswitch" keyword, which indicates that effects fall off rapidly once the subject is no longer being exposed to the hazard. Times are given in rough estimates here; see Notes for details, if available/necessary.

Range: This section contains keywords describing how far away the hazard can affect subjects. For instance, an object which can inflict headaches upon people within about a ten-foot radius might have the Room keyword here. Ranges are given in rough estimates here; see Notes for details.

Containment: This section contains keywords pertaining to safe storage of the object(s), with regard to this Hazard. These details describe how to keep the object(s) under safe, controlled conditions. For example, an object that is easy to contain with physical barriers might have the Concrete keyword here.

Countermeasures: This section contains keywords pertaining to disposal/destruction of the object(s), with regard to this Hazard. These details describe what to do in the event of an Incident. For example, an object that is best dealt with via a single strike might have the Sniper keyword here.

### Notes
The Notes section describes any additional details that cannot be neatly summarized with a keyword. This might include:
- Additional information relating to a keyword (i.e., exact activation method for an object with Hands-On)
- A brief history of the object(s), possibly including accounts of previous Incidents
- Conjecture from the research team about the exact nature of the object(s) or this Hazard (conjecture should be marked as "Research Team Addendum", or "RTA", until/unless it is proven via experimentation)
- Standing orders relating to the object(s) or this Hazard (i.e., a standing order to not conduct further experiments on a given subject)

Each Hazard has its own Notes section. Notes relating to the object(s) in general should go in the Notes section of the most applicable Hazard (i.e., notes about the physical resilience of one object in a set should go into the Notes section of a hazard emanating from that specific object).

## Hazard 02: "Perfectly Generic Object"
A theoretical, perfectly-generic object. This is an example of what a filled-out Hazard section would look like.

Hazard: Mind
Mechanism: Eyeball
Time: Instant, Lightswitch
Range: Room
Containment: Concrete, Idol
Countermeasures: Armor

### Notes
This theoretical object induces headaches in anybody who can get a clear look at it. As a containment procedure, one might simply lock it in a large box or trunk of some kind.

> One of the prevailing theories about anomalous objects is the "legend" theory--the idea that objects become anomalous because of humans mythologizing them, to the point of objects spontaneously manifesting if enough humans believe in a fictional (semi-fictional? pseudo-fictional?) object.

> If we assume this is true, it logically follows that an object needs enough physical details to be believably 'real' in order to manifest. Therefore: The Perfectly Generic Object is a green cube. If enough of our agents read this addendum and start thinking of the PGO as a green cube, we *should*--in theory--eventually see a green cube crop up in our searches for new objects. At that point, the legend theory will be a step or two closer to being proven, and we can start experimenting with more complex 'legends'.
