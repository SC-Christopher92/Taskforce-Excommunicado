### Notes:
This object is one of the cornerstone of Task Force Excommunicado's work.

Placing this object on a person's chest causes immediate heart palpitations . Within approximately one minute of contact, assuming that the box is not removed in the process, the subject 'dies', and their consciousness is transferred into the box. The box will begin to emit a blue light from it's seams. DO NOT OPEN THE BOX. Upon placing the 'charged' box against the chest of any humanoid object the light will cease and the consciousness of the subject will take the place of the object. When this process is completed the object will become a perfect functioning replica of the subject. The object, now known as Subject B, will be able to carry out all tasks Subject A could perfectly. If Subject B dies the consciousness will be transferred back into Subject A.

During the short time of transference of consciousness between Subject B and Subject A the subject will report experiencing an afterlife, often one connected to their personal faith. This is normal. Subjects exhibiting suicidal tendencies post transfer are to report to their site chaplain as soon as possible.
