# Object(s)
1. A gold-plated "Flying V" style electric guitar.
# Hazard 01:
Hazard: Mind.
Mechanism: BFM.
Time: Lightswitch.
Range: Field.
Containment: Music.
Countermeasures: Scatter, Radar/Crowd, Innsmouth.
### Notes:
Inscribed upon the guitar is the phrase "And that one guitar felt good in his hands", a line from the song Jukebox Hero by the band Foreigner. If a person within 10 meters of the guitar speaks this line while no music is playing they will become enthralled and attempt to play the guitar. While playing the guitar the victim can point at a group to incite cheering, temporarily disrupting mental faculties. While holding the guitar the victim has the ability to identify the direction, location, and size of crowds. Repeated exposure to the 'cheering' effect on the victim can cause symptoms similar to psychological dependency.

> I've noticed an odd discrepancy, this object has been in containment since 1978--however, the song Jukebox Hero came out in 1981. I've looked into security logs from the time to see if there were any breaches of containment. There was nothing. It's possible that there may be more than one instance of this anomaly.
