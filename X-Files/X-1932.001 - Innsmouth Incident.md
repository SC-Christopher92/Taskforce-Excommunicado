# Hazard 01: "Mythos"
Hazard: Hypno. 
Range: City.
Mechanism: Arcane, Analog, Cognizant. 
Countermeasures: Idol, Innsmouth, Sniper. 
### Notes: 
Hazard 01 pertains to the effects attributed to a typewriter previously owned by an individual identified as H.P. Lovecraft, a novelist recognized for his contributions to the horror genre. The specific stimuli responsible for triggering the typewriter's effects remain undetermined. 

In November of 1932, a blackout occurred at a National Guard base situated in Innsmouth. Subsequently, a National Guard unit from an adjacent base was dispatched to ascertain the underlying cause, only to encounter an assault from an ostensibly extraterrestrial entity. Initial reports describing fish-like entities possessing exceptional strength were initially disregarded; however, upon the failure of a reconnaissance unit to report back, the true nature of the threat emerged. Over the ensuing month, the situation escalated, prompting the deployment of a battalion of U.S. Marines. Despite sustaining significant casualties, the Marines successfully reclaimed control of the town. Within the central vicinity of Innsmouth, Mr. Lovecraft was discovered unresponsive, engaged in manuscript typing on the aforementioned typewriter. Upon discovery, the Marines terminated Mr. Lovecraft and demolished the typewriter using explosive devices. This incident catalyzed the establishment of The Department of Paranormal Investigation and Task Force Excommunicado.

Given the destruction of the typewriter and the demise of its sole known operator, further elucidation regarding the precise mechanisms of its operation remains elusive. Consequently, all categorizations assigned to this Hazard are speculative in nature.

# Hazard 02: "Fishmen"
Hazard: Stone, Laser, Body. 
Range: Melee/Room. 
Mechanism: Sprinter, Hands-On. 
Containment: Concrete.
Countermeasures: Arrow, Armor, Ambush, Sniper, Innsmouth. 
### Notes: 
Hazard 02 describes the 'Fishmen' that Lovecraft apparently wrote into being using Hazard 01. 
There are technically two effects being described here, but both are centered on the Fishmen. Firstly, they are highly capable in melee combat, and able to effectively close gaps due to a combination of enhanced strength, the ability to shrug off small arms fire, and a level of intelligence described as 'surprising' by witnesses. Survivors described flanking actions that suggested either a network of tunnels between houses, or the ability to teleport, but--given that no fishman was observed while 'teleporting' and that a tunnel network _was_ found under Innsmouth--it is assumed that they used mundane, albeit skilled, tactical maneuvers. 
Secondly, Fishmen are capable of performing a particular gesture with the hands, which inflicts severe, debilitating pain on a single target. The effect is targeted by staring at the victim, and lingers only briefly after line of sight is broken. 
Finally, non-Fishman citizens of Innsmouth were observed giving aid to Fishmen, giving rise to the 'Innsmouth' tag used in DPI/TFE documents.
