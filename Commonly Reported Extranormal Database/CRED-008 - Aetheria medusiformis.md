**Aetherdrift**, Aetheria medusiformis

<AI-PLACEHOLDER>

The Aetherdrift is a mystical and sapient creature that glides through the air with an ethereal grace. Its form resembles the classic "sheet ghost" of folklore, but upon closer inspection, its body is more akin to that of a jellyfish. The creature's defining feature is its translucent, flowing mantle that drapes over it like an eerie, spectral sheet. This mantle undulates gently as it moves, much like the bell of a jellyfish, allowing the Aetherdrift to navigate the air with fluid, rhythmic pulses.

Beneath this ghostly shroud, a faintly humanoid shape can be discerned, adding to its otherworldly appearance. Possessing intelligence and the ability to communicate, Aetherdrifts are ancient beings with a deep understanding of the world. They communicate with humans through a combination of telepathy and a melodic, haunting language that resonates in the minds of those they speak to.

Often found haunting ancient ruins and foggy forests, they are both guardians of forgotten knowledge and guides to those who seek wisdom. Their silent, gliding movements and glowing, spectral form evoke both fear and awe, but those who approach them with respect and genuine intent may find them to be wise and benevolent allies.
