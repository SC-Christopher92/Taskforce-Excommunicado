tl;dr earliest fuckin' draft: You can't do any thaumaturgy without taking a trauma. This shit will fuck your enemies up but also it'll fuck you up if you fail specifically during combat.

### you do damage
Level 1: 1d4 damage
Level 2: 1d6 damage
Level 3: 1d8 damage
Level 4: 1d10 damage
Level 5: 1d12 damage

### you get fucked up
1d4 sanity damage per spell level, 1 level of stress per spell.

If your roll fails:
extra 1d4 sanity damage, +X (where X is spell level) stress.

### Should I even do this?
Base Humans cannot use magic without getting majorly fucked up. They have to die or go through some major trauma. Even the best human mages can only learn up to Level 3 and you must endure another trauma for each level, if you hit level 5 without proper preparations you _become_ the monster being hunted down. Extranormal Humans 

### but not if you take the time to do it right
Level 1: 1 hour
Level 2: 4 hours
Level 3: 8 hours
Level 4: 24 hours
Level 5: 1 week.

### you can do this stuff
1. **Elemental Forces**
2. **Cosmic Energies**
3. **Life Force**
4. **Quantum Manipulation**
5. **Temporal Distortion**
6. **Psychic Influence**
