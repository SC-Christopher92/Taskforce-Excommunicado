### A Long Time Ago
in an alternate universe the united states of america formed the Department of Paranormal Investigation, a subsection of the FBI, in 1932 after a raid on the town of Innsmouth Massachussets after a series of dissappearances in the town. Due to a botched operation a set of rules were put into place to better help operators contain an item and bring it back for study. This taskforce, known as Taskforce Excommunicado became part of the newly formed DPI each site employing several squads. The goal of the DPI is simple, to protect the citizens of the united states from extranormal threats, and to maintain normalcy.

The year is 2004, there are 52 states, the United States and the Soviet Union continue their cold war, and Dr. Williams works out of Site-07 which is in the town of Pinehaven, New Jersey which in our universe is known as Hammonton NJ. The site is primarily set up to monitor a known anomaly that manifests at malls after hours. However this phenomenon, known as a unicorn mall, is not the primary concern. 

### The Inciting Incident (1:30 PM)
Like those many years ago the DPI learns of a case where nearly half a dozen teenagers went missing after the opening of a new arcade at the Ocean City Board Walk.

The Ocean City Police Department underwent an extensive search for the missing teens but over the course of months found nothing, people came forward claiming to be responsible but were cleared after it became obvious these people were only chasing fame. After the case was bumped up to the FBI where it fell into the hands of the Director of the DPI. Suspecting that there is something anomalous involved rather than this being ordinary crime, Agent Vivian Williams, a PHD in Theoretical Physics, and her partner Travis Caldwell, a former Navy Seal, to investigate. 

### Arrival
they arrive at the boardwalk, is it day or night? It's Day.
It's a weekday. Mid afternoon. The highschoolers from ocean city high would be swarming the boardwalk around this time hoping to get a slice of pizza or something other than the bland caffeteria fare, and given it was only a block away who could blame them? But today it was different, no one dared to step up the ramp. 

The arcade isn't very far from the ramp leading from the parking lot. No one is out front, the sign on the door reads closed, but is there any sign on habitation? no but... Travis Notices music coming from within the arcade. is the door locked? Yes, but it's not exactly the most secure thing in the world and travis can probably knock down the door because he's a strong boy, likely.

##### First Action. 1:40 pm
6+4=10+Strength(7(+1))=11 - Success

Travis manages to open the door quite easily, not much force was needed to send the door swinging forward.

**FULL ROOM SEARCH (2:10 pm)** - is there anything out of ordinary in the room yes, but it isn't obvious at first, vivian finds a scorched portion of the carpet in front of an arcade machine the machine is named (something) and is in a back corner of the arcade where the older titles from the 80s and 90s have been shoved away. Vivian wants to conduct research. does simple observation work? (2:20 pm) No but she'd notice that all the top scores in the arcade were by one person.

+1 research point.

### 2:30 pm
Vivian attempts to discern if touching the arcade machine produces any effect:
Yes, and. Vivian knowing damn well as the head of dimensional reasearch that anything can be an anomaly and so produces a tongue depressor from her bag and touches it against the machine, the stick immediately disintegrates into a puff of smoke, and at that moment a low poly version of the depressor appeared on the background of the machine before it was carried off by small red gremlin creatures from the game.

+2 research points. because crit on research roll.

### 2:40 pm
Travis suggests that they go back to site-07 and bring proper equipment and **TFE Unit Delta-17: "Jersey Devils"** assuming that this is indeed a portal to another realm. Vivian agrees. Travel time back to Site-07 is 1:35 minutes, they return to Site-07 at 4:15 pm. rounded up to 4:30pm.

Research points earned: 6 + 4 + 6 = 16  * 2 = 32/56
