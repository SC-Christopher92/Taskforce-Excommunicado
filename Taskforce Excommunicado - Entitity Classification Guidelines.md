# Task Force Excommunicado

There are certain entities and phenomena that the broader public cannot and should not learn about. Things which operate on rules that, to the common man, defy science and God alike.

Such things are dangerous, more often than not. Often, these entities are hostile to humanity, or at least sufficiently detached from our understanding of the world that they do not see killing us as a bad thing. Sometimes, the fate of their victims is worse than death. And when the entity is not actively trying to kill you, it is likely being exploited by a human who will.

Naturally, the world's governments want to control such powerful entities--to use them as weapons, the nuclear warhead of the new age.

The government of the United States of America has a secret military unit dedicated to capturing or neutralizing such entities. They are called Excommunicado, for they act outside of the realm of Man or God.

# Entity Categorization

All entities are assumed to be an immediate threat to life and limb, unless stated otherwise. All entities are assumed to be at least as dangerous as a human in melee combat.

Entities are categorized and labeled according to several key pieces of information, most notably their Effects, their Containment Methods, and their Countermeasures.

## Effects

Each Entity has one or more Effects, which are described and categorized according to keywords. Each Effect has the following information:

- Hazards: Keywords describing what the effect's harmful symptoms are.
- Range: Keywords describing the range at which the effect can affect a victim.
- Mechanism: Keywords describing how the effect is inflicted.
- Notes: Any specific information not covered by a keyword.

For instance, an Effect defined with the following keywords:

> Hazard: Mind
> Range: Room
> Mechanism: Eyeball

would describe an Effect which causes deterioration of mental faculties within a range of about 20 feet (across a room) when the entity is viewed directly.

### Hazard

Hazard keywords are typically combined with one or more of the following 'time' keywords:

- Immediate: For effects which happen quickly, within minutes or seconds of exposure.

- Day: Effects that happen over the course of hours of exposure.

- Week: As Day, but the effects happen over the course of multiple days.

- Month: As above, but over the course of multiple weeks.

- Lifetime: For effects which are only noticeable over multiple years.

- Lightswitch: The effect wears off quickly when the subject is no longer exposed to the effect. It is rare for an entity with an effect timeline of Week, Month, or Lifetime to also have Lightswitch.

Hazards with no time keyword are implicitly Immediate.

The following is an incomplete list of Hazard keywords, and what they mean for the entity or effect described:

- Stone: The entity uses relatively mundane combat, or other natural processes, to harm its targets. Creatures with natural weapons like claws or teeth are categorized here.

- Glass: The effect is not immediately noticeable, or is difficult to perceive from within the area of effect. Invisible creatures also fall under this category.

- Finder: The entity can detect certain objects, creatures, or concepts. Typically written in the form of Finder/\[object], where \[object] is the thing that the entity can detect.

- Snatcher: The entity can control humans, and can spread through its control of humans.

- Mind: The entity has a detrimental effect on reasoning or memory.

- Bone: The entity has a detrimental effect on physical ability--typically strength and endurance, though this sometimes affects dexterity as well.

- Muscle: The entity enhances the strength of things it is affecting. Not as good as it sounds.

- Hypno: The entity can control humans, but *cannot* spread via the same mechanism. The entity may use this control of humans to spread via a secondary mechanism, i.e., breaching containment by manipulating personnel into opening a door.

- Psion: The entity can manipulate or create objects at a distance. This is similar to Javelin in the Mechanism subcategory--however, Javelin implies that the threat comes directly from the entity (like a gun) while Psion implies that the entity can attack from unexpected angles (i.e., a poltergeist throwing objects).

- Hannibal: The entity can either mimic sapience, or is sapient, and can use direct or indirect manipulation tactics. This typically implies that the entity can speak a language.

- Pyro: This effect can start fires. Note that an entity that *appears* to manipulate flame does not qualify; this keyword covers entities that can start *actual* fires which spread without the entity's influence.

- Cryo: This effect causes a sudden drop in temperature. This can range in intensity from a sudden chill to immediate hypothermia.

- Lightning: The entity can manipulate electrical charge. While this can manifest as malfunctions in electronic equipment, it does not have any relation to Gremlin.

- Gremlin: The entity can cause malfunctions in equipment, typically electronics (both analog and digital).

- Skyfall: The entity can affect the weather. This typically takes the form of weather growing much worse in a short period of time, though it can also include weather growing calm suddenly.

- Druid: The entity can summon independent sub-entities. This is distinct from Psion, in that the objects summoned can act independently of the thing which created them--i.e., destroying the parent entity does not cause them to stop.

- Highlander: The effect described here grows more powerful upon successfully killing a victim.

- Black Knight: The effect described here grows more powerful when the entity is harmed.

- Mimic: The entity can disguise itself in some way. Sometimes this includes disguising itself as a human, which is distinct from Snatcher and Hypno--it is not controlling a victim, it is merely disguised as one. Sometimes this includes disguising itself as a mundane object. See notes for specifics.

- Diamond: The effect described here is illusory. Note that this does not imply the effect is not harmful--only that it is not physically real.

- Angel: The effect described here is less-than-lethal. This does not imply that the effect will not mentally or physically harm a target, only that the victim will still be conscious and will not suffer ego-death in the process.

- Skull: Due to the effects described here, you are authorized to kill any human who is likely to die because of or while affected by this effect.

### Range

The rough distance at which the entity can cause this effect.

- Melee: The effect can only occur within a roughly 5-foot radius around the entity. Essentially, you must be close enough to start a fistfight with the entity. It should go without saying that punching an entity is a bad idea.

- Room: The effect can occur within a 10 to 20 foot radius--i.e., from across a bedroom or living room.

- Street: The effect can occur within a 30 to 50 foot radius--i.e., across a multi-lane street.

- Field: The effect can occur within 100 to 300 feet--for instance, from across a football field.

- City: The effect has a range measured in miles.

- State: The effect has a range measured in hundreds of miles.

- Country: The effect has a range measured in thousands of miles.

- Planet: The effect can reach from one side of the planet to the other, or has no known range limit.

### Mechanism

An effect's Mechanism describes *how* the effect happens. Where Hazard describes *what* the entity is doing to you, Mechanism describes *how to mitigate it*.

The following is an incomplete list of Mechanism keywords:

- Eyeball: The effect described here occurs while line of sight is maintained with the entity. Obscuring your vision, blinking, or using the environment to obscure your view of the target are all potential ways to disrupt this effect. Typically, Eyeball does not imply that viewing a recording or via a mirror has an effect, but it *does* imply that viewing through a lens has an effect (unless otherwise stated).

- Camera: The effect described here occurs when the entity is observed via video devices or other methods of recording visual information. This is separate from Lens; some entities are dangerous when viewed directly but less so when viewed via camera, others are dangerous when viewed through a camera but benign when viewed directly, and some cannot be observed safely at all.

- Mirror: The effect described here occurs when the entity is viewed through a mirror. This includes devices which use mirrors to function, such as reflecting telescopes and periscopes.

- Lens: The effect described here occurs when the entity is viewed through any material which refracts light more than air does. This includes lenses, obviously, but also includes devices which use lenses (i.e., telescopes or prescription glasses) as well as unintentional distortions (i.e., mirages caused by heat, or the refracting effect of a tank of water).

- Ear: The effect described here occurs when the entity makes a noise, which is heard directly.

- Speaker: The effect described here occurs when the victim listens to a recorded version of a sound the entity has made. As with Lens and Camera, Ear and Speaker are separate--not all effects with Ear have Speaker, and vice versa.

- Arcane: The effect described here has some set of rules which governs it, and correctly obeying these rules mitigates or prevents harm.

- Contact: The effect described here requires direct contact with the entity. This is normally only seen on Effects which are describing some form of supernatural harm. Does not imply that the effect happens immediately on contact; some effects may require contact at some point prior to activation, but allow for an indefinite period of time before triggering.

- Javelin: The effect described here is triggered by a projectile of some sort making contact with the victim. Objects between the entity and the victim may block the effect. This does not imply you can dodge the effect.

- Laser: The effect described here can be maintained as long as the entity maintains line of sight with its target. The inverse of Eyeball. Like with Eyeball, breaking line of sight disrupts the effect, but unlike with Eyeball, you must disrupt the *entity's* vision--you cannot break the effect by blinking, for instance.

- Sprinter: The entity can move deceptively fast, and will cover ground quickly to trigger it.

- Cognizant: The effect described here can be triggered as long as the entity is aware of its target. This is arguably the most dangerous mechanism keyword. Dealing with this effect requires immediate, decisive actions to neutralize the entity before this effect can come into play.

- Digital: The effect described here can only be triggered through a digital electronic medium. This typically includes most modern computer devices, but does *not* include analog technologies (i.e., certain early magnetic-tape storage mediums are not affected).

- Analog: The effect described here can only be triggered through some form of analog electronic medium. This mostly means either radio or magnetic-tape storage systems such as VHS. Digital recordings, such as video recorded using any camera within the past ten or fifteen years, are unaffected.

- Pigment: The effect described here can only be triggered through a symbol or pattern made using physical pigmentation. In other words, displaying the pattern on a screen has no effect; printing the pattern and viewing it on paper does have an effect. Note that some Pigment effects may require a *specific* ink or paper (these are often also classified as Arcane).

- Hands-On: The entity has to directly participate in a specific action for the effect to trigger. For example, a Hands-On Pigment effect would require the entity to draw a specific pattern.

- BFM: The effect is triggered by speaking a specific phrase or creating a specific sound. Separate from Ear and Speaker; a BFM effect can be triggered by a human, machine, or entity saying/playing back the key phrase.

- Catch Phrase: The effect can be triggered against any target, so long as the entity knows the target's full name.

- X-Ray: The effect can be triggered through walls or obstructions, but is otherwise limited to line of sight.

- Lead Shirt: The effect is blocked by a specific material. See notes for details.

- Wielder: The entity does not trigger this effect. Instead, this effect is triggered by a human who has control of the entity.

# Containment

The information given in Containment describes strategies for safely storing and controlling a given entity. Like with Effects, there are certain keywords that can be used to categorize entities by features of their containment strategies. An incomplete list of keywords follows:

- Concrete: The entity is bound to a physical body, and physical restraints are effective.

- Buffer: The entity's effects require it to be stored a certain distance away from humans for safety reasons.

- Darkness: The entity responds favorably to darkness, or responds harmfully to exposure to light.

- Spotlight: The entity responds favorably to being in the light, or responds harmfully to being left in the dark.

- Heat: The entity is calmer in hot environments.

- Cold: As above, but for cold environments. Check notes for exact temperatures, if known.

- Music: The entity has a specific audio stimulus that induces calm or lethargy.

- Dollhouse: The entity can be contained by placing specific objects in a certain pattern; see notes.

- Lost Lamb: The entity requires a sacrifice of some sort on a periodic basis.

- Ritual: The entity requires a human to perform a certain set of actions on a periodic basis. Often related to effects with the Arcane keyword.

- Lens Cap: The entity must be stored in a location with no cameras.

- Dragon: The entity must be 'killed' repeatedly to maintain containment.

- Zen: The entity does not maintain a specific physical position, and may appear in any location at any time. One of the more dangerous containment keywords. Often paired with Dragon, but Dragon does not imply Zen.

- Silence: As in radio silence. Communication about the entity must be kept to a minimum.

- Blanket: As in security blanket. The entity has a specific object which calms it down, and this object must be kept near the entity at all times.

- Luddite: The facility storing this entity must minimize use of electronics as much as possible.

- Party: The entity desires companionship, and will remain calm so long as it is able to socialize.

- Reason: The entity is either not actively hostile, or does not understand that it is harming humans--but it *can* be reasoned with. The entity will remain peaceful if it can be convinced.

- Idol: The entity is an inanimate object. This typically means that the primary concern in containment is keeping other humans from stealing it or making contact with it, as opposed to keeping the entity itself from escaping.

- Radar: There is a proven method of detecting the entity. This can mean the ability to detect whether a human is affected by the entity (in the case of Snatcher effects, for instance), proximity detection, directional detection, or perfect positional detection. Typically, the detection equipment is man-portable, but sometimes detecting the entity requires a complex or bulky piece of equipment; see notes.

- Ghost: The entity is not bound to a physical form; physical restraints are not effective.

- Shrine: The entity or its effects are bound to a specific geographical location, such as a particular building, town, or landmark. See notes for exact locations. The opposite of Zen.

- Saltmine: The entity cannot cross or interact with certain materials. The exact material and its effects will be detailed in the notes; this can range from the entity not being able to cross lines drawn with a certain material, to the entity's effects being blocked by certain materials, or even cases where the material causes harm to the entity on contact. Often paired with the Lead Shirt keyword on effects, but not always.

# Countermeasures

In an ideal world, the Containment section would be enough to prevent fatalities. This is not a perfect world. Containment breaches do happen, and enemies of the state have already found ways to use entities as weapons of mass destruction. The following keywords pertain to Countermeasure strategies--means of killing, weakening, or controlling an entity when it is actively hostile.

- Arrow: The entity is best engaged at a distance with ranged weapons, typically firearms.

- Armor: The entity has supernatural resistance to harm, either because of the materials it is made out of or because of one of its effects. Regular firearms will have reduced effect and may have no effect at all.

- Silver: The entity is harmed by a specific material, listed in the notes. Sometimes related to Saltmine in Containment, or Lead Shirt in an Effect.

- Sniper: The entity is best dealt with in a single blow. Extended engagements are dangerous.

- Ambush: The entity is best dealt with via sneak attack. Extended engagements are dangerous. Often paired with Sniper.

- Headshot: The entity is vulnerable to attacks which target the head.

- Amputate: The entity is vulnerable to removal of limbs.

- Healer: The entity can recover from wounds at a supernatural rate. This may be conditional; check notes and the Effects for more details.

- Buddy: The entity is particularly deadly against lone targets; remain near teammates when possible.

- Backstab: The entity uses disguises, illusions, or manipulation to cause infighting or isolate members of a fireteam. Before engaging, determine code phrases both for signalling friendliness and for use when under duress.

- Scatter: The entity's effects are particularly good at killing groups of targets. Maintain a minimum distance between fireteam members to minimize casualties.

- Innsmouth: The entity is likely to have manipulated any civilians that it has made contact with. Do not trust locals.

- Radar: Much like the Radar keyword in Containment, there is a proven method of detecting the entity or its influence. See notes for details.

- Sword: The entity is best engaged in CQC. This typically means that the entity is vulnerable to blades or invulnerable to bullets, since normally engaging an entity in melee combat is a terrible idea.

- Phase: The entity is intangible. Look to other keywords for information about what can harm this entity.

- Banish: The entity is vulnerable to a ritual, incantation, or other supernatural effect.

- Lure: The entity is compelled to take certain actions under certain conditions, i.e., it may be compelled to untie knots, or to follow certain orders. See notes for details.

- Symbol: The entity is harmed by specific symbols. Separate from Banish in that no additional action is required to harm the entity with the symbol; for example, an entity that is harmed by seeing a cross is categorized with Symbol, but an entity which is only harmed by the brandishing of a cross while incanting "Get thee behind me, demon!" is categorized with Banish.

- Master: The entity is controlled by another entity, and neutralizing the controlling entity will neutralize this one.

- Totem: The entity is harmed by the destruction or defacing of an inanimate object related to it (the 'totem'). Typically, the totem is something symbolically significant to the entity.
