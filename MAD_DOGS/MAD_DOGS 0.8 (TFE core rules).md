# Rolling The Dice
The only set of dice needed for this game is a set of two six sided dice and a set of the standard polyhedral dice. 

### The Basic Roll 
Player rolls 2d6 + Skill + Stat, Referee rolls 2d12. Compare the total sum of the 2d6 roll to the face value + Difficulty of the d12s separately. Refer to the chart for resolving the outcome. A roll of 2 will always result in a failure, a roll of 12 will always result in a success.

| 2d6 Doubles | d12 #1 | d12 #2 | Result    |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| No          | ≤      | ≤      | Failure   |
| Yes         | ≤      | ≤      | Cost (-1) |
| No          | ≤      | \>     | Cost      |
| Yes         | ≤      | \>     | Cost (+1) |
| No          | \>     | \>     | Success   |
| Yes         | \>     | \>     | Crit      |
**Failure:** Deal no damage. Enemy **Counter Attack**, Gain a point of stress. 
**Cost:** Succeed at a cost, in combat deal you may make an attack but will do half damage rounded down. The enemy is allowed to **Counter Attack** 
**Success:** You succeed. In combat deal your full amount of damage. **Crit:** You succeed spectacularly, roll your damage and multiply it by two. Gain a point of High.

See: [[#Attacking & Counterattacks]].

#### Compare Roll Difficulty Rating
Add the following to the 2d12 roll: 
- Trivial: +0 
- Normal: +2 
- Difficult: +4 
- Hard: +6 
- Impossible: +8

# Creating an Agent
### The Basics
Every Agent needs a few things: 
- A name.
- Role
- Background
- Their Sex. 
- Their Gender.
- Their Six Stats. 
- Their Health Points (HP). 
- Their Fortitude (FT). 
##### Role
WIP
##### Background
WIP
##### Sex & Gender
##### Six Stats
See [[#Stats]].
##### Health Points (HP)
HP represents your characters overall physical and mental health, when this reaches 0 or lower the character will be considered unable to act until their hp returns above 0. Your character's **HP** starts at four (4) HP and adding the score, not the modifier, of your Strength and Agility together and multiplying by two. (HP = 4 + (STR + AGI) \* 2).
##### Fortitude (FT)
**Fortitude** represents your character's resilience in deflecting or absorbing damage. It functions to reduce the amount of damage taken from incoming attacks. Each point of Fortitude decreases incoming damage by one hit point (HP). When Fortitude successfully blocks all incoming damage, it decreases by one point until reaching zero (0). Fortitude fully replenishes after a Long Rest or partially replenishes by half (rounded down) after a Short Rest.

To calculate your character's Fortitude, begin with zero (0), then add the total score (not the modifier) of your Luck and Agility. Finally, divide the sum by two and round down to the nearest whole number (Fortitude = (Luck + Agility) / 2).
##### Traumas
For every failed roll a character gains one trauma, on a critical fail, two. Traumas can be distributed into skills. See [[#Skills]].
### Stats 
Each character has six stats, Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Education, Influence, and Luck. These base.

| Stat         | Influence                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Strength     | HP, Melee Attacks, Physical Skills.  |
| Agility      | Ranged Attacks, Acrobatics Skills.   |
| Intelligence | Technical Attacks, Technical Skills. |
| Education    | Survival Skills, Academic Skills.    |
| Influence    | Social Skills, Command Skills        |
| Luck         | Used for non-standard skills.        |
Stats start at level 1 and go up to level 20. Your stat bonus increases by one (1) for every five (5) points allocated into the skill. The average skill level is 5-9, anything below 5 counts as a -1 penalty.

| Level | Bonus |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1-4   | \-1   |
| 5-9   | ±0    |
| 10-14 | +1    |
| 15-19 | +2    |
| 20+   | +3    |
### Assigning Stats
Roll 2d6 six (6) times, assign the rolls to each stat in any order. Alternatively you may assign 24 points across each of the skills. 
### Luck 
In the event that a player is called to roll for a skill while they are still at the Novice (0) level, rather than applying the skill bonus the player will apply their Luck Bonus. 
### Skills 
Every character will start with sixteen (16) skill points which they will assign to the following skills. Skill levels go from 0 to 5. Novice (0), Apprentice (1), Journeyman (2), Craftsman (3), Artisan (4), Master (5). Each skill level gives +1 to rolls made using the skill up to +5. For each category there are four slots for custom skills. If a skill you think your character should have is not on the list talk this over with the referee during character creation to add a custom skill.

| Physical     | Acrobatics | Technical | Academic    | Survival     | Humanities   | Social       | Command      |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Balance      | Parkour    | Mechanics | History     | Foraging     | Philosophy   | Leadership   | Strategy     |
| Reflexes     | Precision  | Research  | Linguistics | Hunting      | Theology     | Diplomacy    | Tactics      |
| Stamina      | Stealth    | Design    | Philosophy  | Construction | Arts         | Etiquette    | Logistics    |
| Endurance    | Tumbling   | Crafting  | Science     | Navigation   | Psychology   | Persuasion   | Leadership   |
| Adaptability | Vaulting   | Carpentry | Literature  | Nature Lore  | Archeology   | Networking   | Organization |
| Flexibility  | Dodging    | Farming   | Politics    | First Aid    | Anthropology | Intimidation | Planning     |
|              |            |           |             |              |              |              |              |
|              |            |           |             |              |              |              |              |
|              |            |           |             |              |              |              |              |
|              |            |           |             |              |              |              |              |
##### Experience
1. **Initial Character Creation**: When you first create your character, you allocate skill levels. These are the starting points for your skills.
2. **Improving Skills**: After character creation, the only way to increase a skill level is by failing a roll related to that skill.
3. **Earning Experience Points (XP)**: When a character fails a roll, they gain an experience point (XP). This represents the character learning from their mistakes or experiences, possibly through some sort of mental training or process like DPI (if that's what you intended).
4. **Spending XP**: Experience points can then be spent to increase skills. To increase a skill, you need to spend a certain amount of XP on it.
5. **Resetting the Counter**: After spending the required amount of XP to increase a skill, you reset the XP counter for that skill back to 0. This means you start again from scratch in terms of accumulating XP for that skill.
6. **Skill Progression**: The amount of XP needed to progress from one skill level to another increases with each tier. For example, to move from Novice to Apprentice might require 10 XP, but to move from Apprentice to Journeyman might require 50 XP.

| Traumas | Skill Level |
| ------- | ----------- |
| 0       | Novice      |
| 10      | Apprentice  |
| 50      | Journeyman  |
| 100     | Craftsman   |
| 250     | Artisan     |
| 500     | Master      |
### Stress & High
Throughout the game, characters will accumulate Stress and High points. For each point of Stress a character possesses, they suffer a -1 penalty on their rolls. Stress can be alleviated by expending a High point. Each High point spent reduces the character's Stress by 1. Additionally, at any moment, a High point can be expended to grant a +1 bonus to a roll for each point spent.

If a character's Stress exceeds 5 points, they lose 1 HP for each additional point of Stress beyond 5, and their Stress resets to 5. Players can maintain a maximum of 3 High points at any given time.
# Combat
## Spaces, Movement & Turns 
##### Spaces 
A **Space** is a square or hexagon taking up 5 ft. A character does not necessarily take up the entire 5 foot square rather it is the space that they reliably control. 
##### Movement 
Characters may move 6 + Agility Bonus spaces in a turn. 
##### Turns 
Combat is split into two turns, the player round and the opponent round. The players all act within a single turn, which order is up to the players. The players will always act first, then the opponents. During a turn a player may take their movement and make one attack if able. 
## Cover & Half Cover 
During the course of combat players will find themselves under attack. During their turn the players may choose to move behind obstacles. If a character is covered from sight above their head from the perspective of an opponent they are in complete cover and cannot take damage. If a character is covered from the waist down and could reasonable duck behind the object they are in half cover and will take 1/2 incoming damage. 
## Healing & Resting 
###### Short Rests 
During a Short Rest a player regains 1d6 + LCK HP and 1 fortitude per hour spent resting. For each hour of rest have a player roll 1d6 + LCK, if the result is four (4) or below the rest is interrupted. 
###### Long Rests 
During a Long Rest a player regains their full HP and FT. This is assumed to take 24 hours of uninterrupted rest in a Safe Location such as a town, outpost, or other non wilderness locations.
## Attacking & Counterattacks
tl;dr the character and the enemy attack at the same time, if you fail you miss and the enemy doesn't, if you cost you deal half damage but the enemy deals full damage, if you succeed the enemy misses and you deal full damage. A failed combat roll does not count towards traumas. 
# Death
When an Agent's hit points reach 0, they experience temporary demise, swiftly followed by resurrection. Thanks to a blend of cutting-edge medical advancements and the utilization of anomalous phenomena, death becomes a negligible concern for DPI and TFE operatives. Rest assured, the agency values the unique skills and expertise each agent contributes, ensuring their return to duty.

However, this reassurance doesn't extend to the quality of one's afterlife. The experience of death and the subsequent interlude in the beyond may prove unsettling. Upon revival, agents should prepare for a reset: set stress to 5 and high to 0. Then, roll a d6 to ascertain the nature of their afterlife experience.

| 1d6 | Effect                    |
| --- | ------------------------- |
| 1   | **The Eternal Ballroom**  |
| 2   | **The Library of Almina** |
| 3   | **The White Halls**       |
| 4   | **The Forest**            |
| 5   | **The Farms**             |
