# Rolling The Dice

The only set of dice needed for this game is a set of two six sided dice and a set of the standard polyhedral dice. ### The Basic Roll Player rolls 2d6 + Skill + Stat, Referee rolls 2d12. Compare the total sum of the 2d6 roll to the face value + Difficulty of the d12s separately. Refer to the chart for resolving the outcome. A roll of 2 will always result in a failure, a roll of 12 will always result in a success.

| 2d6 Doubles | d12 #1 | d12 #2 | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No  | ≤   | ≤   | Failure |
| Yes | ≤   | ≤   | Cost (-1) |
| No  | ≤   | \>  | Cost |
| Yes | ≤   | \>  | Cost (+1) |
| No  | \>  | \>  | Success |
| Yes | \>  | \>  | Crit |

**Failure:** Deal no damage. Take a point of stress. **Cost:** Succeed at a cost, in combat deal you may make an attack but will do half damage rounded down. The enemy is allowed to **Counter Attack** **Success:** You succeed. In combat deal your full amount of damage. **Crit:** You succeed spectacularly, roll your damage and multiply it by two. Gain a point of High.

#### Compare Roll Difficulty Rating

Add the following to the 2d12 roll: - Trivial: +0 - Normal: +2 - Difficult: +4 - Hard: +6 - Impossible: +8

# Building a Character

### The Basics

Every character needs a few things: 
- A name. 
- An age. 
- Their Sex. 
- Their Gender. 
- Their Six Stats. 
- Their Health Points (HP). 
- Their Fortitude (FT). 
- Their Assets. 
- Their Stress/High.

**HP** is calculated by starting with four (4) HP and adding the score, not the modifier, of your Strength and Agility together and multiplying by two. (HP = 4 + (STR + AGI) \* 2)

**Fortitude** is calculated by starting with zero (0) and adding the score, not the modifier, of your Luck and Agility. (DP = 4 + LCK +AGI)

**Assets:** This represents your total amount of money. Roll 2d12 \* 100 for your initial Assets. ### Stats Each character has six stats, Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Education, Influence, and Luck. These base

| Stat | Influence |
| --- | --- |
| Strength | HP, Melee Attacks, Physical Skills. |
| Agility | Ranged Attacks, Acrobatics Skills. |
| Intelligence | Technical Attacks, Technical Skills. |
| Education | Survival Skills, Academic Skills. |
| Influence | Social Skills, Command Skills |
| Luck | Used for non-standard skills. |

Stats start at level 1 and go up to level 20. Your stat bonus increases by one (1) for every five (5) points allocated into the skill. The average skill level is 5-9, anything below 5 counts as a -1 penalty.

| Level | Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 1-4 | \-1 |
| 5-9 | ±0  |
| 10-14 | +1  |
| 15-19 | +2  |
| 20+ | +3  |

### Assigning Stats

Roll 2d6 six (6) times, assign the rolls to each stat in any order. Alternatively you may assign 24 points across each of the skills. ### Luck In the event that a player is called to roll for a skill while they are still at the Novice (0) level, rather than applying the skill bonus the player will apply their Luck Bonus. ### Skills Every character will start with sixteen (16) skill points which they will assign to the following skills. Skill levels go from 0 to 5. Novice (0), Apprentice (1), Journeyman (2), Craftsman (3), Artisan (4), Master (5). Each skill level gives +1 to rolls made using the skill up to +5. For each category there are four slots for custom skills. If a skill you think your character should have is not on the list talk this over with the referee during character creation to add a custom skill.

| Physical | Acrobatics | Technical | Academic | Survival | Humanities | Social | Command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Balance | Parkour | Mechanics | History | Foraging | Philosophy | Leadership | Strategy |
| Reflexes | Precision | Research | Linguistics | Hunting | Theology | Diplomacy | Tactics |
| Stamina | Stealth | Design | Philosophy | Construction | Arts | Etiquette | Logistics |
| Endurance | Tumbling | Crafting | Science | Navigation | Psychology | Persuasion | Leadership |
| Adaptability | Vaulting | Carpentry | Literature | Nature Lore | Archeology | Networking | Organization |
| Flexibility | Dodging | Farming | Politics | First Aid | Anthropology | Intimidation | Planning |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

### Stress / High

During the course of the game characters will accrue points of Stress and High, for each point of Stress a character has they apply a -1 to the result of their rolls. Stress can be cured by burning a point of High. For each point of High burned the character loses 1 stress. A point of high can be burned at any time to add +1 to a roll for each point spent. For each point of stress a character gains over 3 they lose 1 HP and the stress will reset to 3. Players can have up to 5 High.

# Combat

okay so theoretically the math works out that your bare minimum hp is 8, that’s if you only have a score of 1 in strength and agility. the theoretical maximum is 4 + (20+20) \* 2 so… 84… 
## Spaces, Movement & Turns 
##### Spaces 
A **Space** is a square or hexagon taking up 5 ft. A character does not necessarily take up the entire 5 foot square rather it is the space that they reliably control. 
##### Movement 
Characters may move 6 + Agility Bonus spaces in a turn. 
##### Turns 
Combat is split into two turns, the player round and the opponent round. The players all act within a single turn, which order is up to the players. The players will always act first, then the opponents. During a turn a player may take their movement and make one attack if able. 
## Cover & Half Cover 
During the course of combat players will find themselves under attack. During their turn the players may choose to move behind obstacles. If a character is covered from sight above their head from the perspective of an opponent they are in complete cover and cannot take damage. If a character is covered from the waist down and could reasonable duck behind the object they are in half cover and will take 1/2 incoming damage.

HP represents your characters overall physical and mental health, when this reaches 0 the character is either at **Death’s Door** or will go out in a **Blaze of Glory**. 
##### Fortitude 
Fortitude reduces the amount of damage that a character takes from incoming attacks, for each point of fortitude the incoming damage is reduced by one HP. Each time that the player’s fortitude blocks all incoming damage their Fortitude is reduced by one until it hits zero (0). Fortitude will return in full after a Long Rest or in half (rounded down) during a short rest. 
##### Healing & Resting 
###### Short Rests 
During a Short Rest a player regains 1d6 + LCK HP and 1 fortitude per hour spent resting. For each hour of rest have a player roll 1d6 + LCK, if the result is four (4) or below the rest is interrupted. 
###### Long Rests 
During a Long Rest a player regains their full HP and FT. This is assumed to take 24 hours of uninterrupted rest in a Safe Location such as a town, outpost, or other non wilderness locations. 

## Death 
##### Death’s Door 
Roll 2d6 + LCK three times, for each result under 8 take a miss, every roll above 8 is a hit. If you have more misses than hits your character is considered dead.
