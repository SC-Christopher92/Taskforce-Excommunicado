### Magic System: Probabilistics  Mechanics

This magic system, Probabilistics, integrates seamlessly with the existing ruleset while adding an engaging risk-reward element with direct consequences on Sanity (SAN). Here's how each magical ability can be incorporated:

#### **Core Mechanic**
All Probabilistics abilities are activated by rolling 2d6 + Probabilistics. Use the table below to determine the outcome:

| **Roll** | **Outcome**          | **Effect**                                                    | **Sanity Impact**     |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 2-6      | **Failure**          | The ability fails, and SAN loss occurs.                       | -1d6 SAN              |
| 7-9      | **Partial Success**  | The ability succeeds with a drawback.                         | -1 SAN                |
| 10-11    | **Full Success**     | The ability succeeds without drawbacks.                       | None                  |
| 12+      | **Critical Success** | The ability succeeds spectacularly, with additional benefits. | +1 High (No SAN loss) |

- **Probabilistics Modifier (PBR)**: A new stat that reflects the character's proficiency in Mysticism. Starts at 1 and can be increased like other stats. You gain +2 for each Trauma (up to +5).

For each Trauma roll 1d6, abilities cannot stack.

### **Integration with Existing Mechanics**

- **Sanity Impact**: Failure in using Mysticism directly impacts SAN, aligning with the thematic risk of meddling with supernatural forces.
- **Stress and High**: Using Mysticism can generate High on Critical Successes, providing a benefit for effective use.
- **Resting and Recovery**: Recovering SAN through rest integrates well with the existing system, as characters must manage both physical and mental resilience.

### **New Skills and Stat Integration**

- **Mysticism Skill**: A new skill representing the character's ability to control and master Mysticism. This can be trained and increased with EXP.
- **Mysticism Modifier (MYS)**: A new stat added during character creation, influencing the success rate of Mysticism abilities.

### **Character Creation Adjustments**

1. **Allocate MYS**: Add a starting MYS score. Characters start with MYS 1 and can increase it using their initial points.
2. **Mysticism Skill**: Introduce Mysticism as a skill that characters can improve during the game.

### **Example Character Adjustments**

- **Stats**: Allocate points as before but include the new MYS stat.
- **Skills**: Characters may choose to allocate skill points to Mysticism.

This system blends with the existing mechanics while adding depth to character abilities and creating compelling risks for using supernatural powers. Players will need to balance their use of Mysticism with the potential mental strain it causes, leading to strategic decision-making during gameplay.
