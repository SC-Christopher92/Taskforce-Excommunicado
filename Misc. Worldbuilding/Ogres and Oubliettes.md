Invented by Larry Lomax in 1973 Ogres and Oubliettes came out of the wargaming scene and quickly overtook a little known project known as dungeons and dragons as the main TTRPG. By 2004 [[CRED-009 - The Fandom]] has infiltrated the very meta concept of T&T in the setting and is responsible for [[X-2004.05.08.001 - The Dark Portal]].
