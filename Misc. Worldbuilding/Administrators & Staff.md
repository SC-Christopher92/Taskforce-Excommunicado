### Administrator Isla Foster
Administrator Isla Foster understands Pataphysics. She understands stories, too. So she realizes that Pataphysics as a study have an inherent trait that is often overlooked, and it is this: The Pataphysics Department is an inherent magnet for protagonists. Any sufficiently advanced study into narrative anomalies is more than twice as likely than any other to attract a certain level of what she calls Narrative Chaos and most other Administrators would consider Absolute Bullshit. 

And then she made her proposal. She would turn Site-20 into a narrative heatsink of sorts. Send in protagonists of all sorts, the oddballs and eccentrics, the useful outcasts. She'd make them into a force to be reckoned with, turn them into a force to keep the world safer.  And all while she did that, the stories would look to them. And across the board, rates of containment failure dropped just a little bit everywhere else.
